# Pre-commit gate: ensures /check-patterns has been run against the EXACT
# current staged diff before allowing the commit.
#
# The stamp file (.patterns-checked) stores the sha256 hash of `git diff
# --cached` at the moment the audit completed. On commit, we re-compute
# the hash and only let the commit proceed if it matches — that way:
#   * Adding files after the audit invalidates the stamp.
#   * lint-staged --fix mutating staged files invalidates the stamp.
#   * Stale stamps from previous sessions don't accidentally allow a commit.
